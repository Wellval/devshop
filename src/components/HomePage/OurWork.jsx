                        from the start. Our main desire is rather than work with the cheapest developers, we work 
                        with high-quality developers but still within your budget by building out a leaner product. 
                        By focusing on the core benefit, or core problem, we can help you eliminate down to the bare 
                        minimum what your customers really canâ€™t live without. We take on the vision of your product 
                        and work with you to become your software partners, ideally even becoming a semi-permanent part 
                        of your team, ensuring the final success of your project.</p>
                        <p className="p-20">In software development, LESS IS MORE. The simpler, the better.</p>
                        <p className="p-20">We are NOT about building software to quickly move on to the next project.</p>
